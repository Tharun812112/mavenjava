Note:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. It ask for user credentials for login ,provide the credentials of tomcat.
To add tomcat credentials got to eclipse Server/tomcat-users.xml, scroll down you notice user name and
pass word.
Copy them and go to jenkins: managejenkins/credentails, in stores scoped jenkins click on (global) add
the credentials(username and password).
It provide the page with out project name which is highlighted.
After clicking on our project we can see output.

Start Minikube
1. Open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD). Do the following commands
2. Start Minikube with a specified driver (e.g., Hyper-V, Docker, or VirtualBox). For example:
o Hyper-V:
o minikube start --driver=hyperv
o Docker:
o minikube start —driver=docker
Interact with Minikube
kubectl is a command-line tool used in Kubernetes to interact with and manage Kubernetes clusters.
Once Minikube is running:
1. Use kubectl to interact with the cluster.
o Install kubectl if not already installed:
o minikube kubectl -- get pods -A
o Or download it separately from the official Kubernetes site.
Nagios Automation Steps
Step 1: Pull the Nagios Docker Image
• Open a terminal and run:
docker pull jasonrivers/nagios:latest
Step 2: Run Nagios
• Command:
docker run --name nagiosdemo -p 8888:80 jasonrivers/nagios:latest
Step 3: Access Nagios Dashboard
• Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8888
o Login Credentials:
▪
Username: nagiosadmin
▪
Password: nagios
o Once logged in, explore:
▪
Hosts: View systems being monitored.
▪

2. Delete the Container:
o Command:
docker rm nagiosdemo
3. Remove the Image (Optional):
o List images:
docker images

Setting Up Jenkins CI------using GitHub Webhook with Jenkins
Step 1: Configure Webhook in GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to Settings → Webhooks.
3. Click “Add webhook”.
4. In the Payload URL field:
o Enter the Jenkins webhook URL in the format:
http://<jenkins-server-url>/github-webhook/
Note: If Jenkins is running on localhost, GitHub cannot access it directly.
Use ngrok to expose your local Jenkins to the internet:
o ngrok.exe http <Jenkins local host:8080>
▪
Use the generated ngrok URL, e.g.:
▪
http://abc123.ngrok.io/github-webhook/
5. Set Content type to:
application/json
6. Under “Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?”, select:
o Just the push event
7. Click “Add webhook” to save.
Step 2: Configure Jenkins to Accept GitHub Webhooks
1. Open Jenkins Dashboard.
2. Select the job (freestyle or pipeline) you’ve already created.
3. Click Configure.
4. Scroll down to the Build Triggers section.
5. Check the box: ✅ GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
6. Click Save.
Step 3: Test the Setup
1. Make any code update in your local repo and push it to GitHub.
2. Once pushed, GitHub will trigger the webhook.
3. Jenkins will automatically detect the change and start the build pipeline.
outcome
• You’ve successfully connected GitHub and Jenkins using webhooks.
• Every time you push code to GitHub, Jenkins will automatically start building your project without manual intervention.
Set-uping the ngrok
How to Install and Use ngrok
Step 1. Download ngrok
https://ngrok.com/download
Download and extract it for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Step 2. Connect Your ngrok Account (optional but useful)
After you sign up (free), ngrok gives you an auth token.
CREATE AUTHENTICATOR [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken]
Run this command (replace <your_token> with yours):
ngrok config add-authtoken <your_token>
This ensures stable sessions and more control.
Step 3. Start a Tunnel for Jenkins
Assuming Jenkins runs locally on port 8085:
ngrok http 8085
You’ll see output like:
Session Status online
Forwarding https://1234abcd.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080
Copy the HTTPS URL (https://1234abcd.ngrok.io) — this is your public Jenkins URL for webhooks.
Step 4. Use it in GitHub Webhook
In your GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks:
• Payload URL: [paste the url generated by ngrok]
https://1234abcd.ngrok.io/github-webhook/ [please include this – remaining all default]
Now, whenever you push code, GitHub sends an event to that URL, which ngrok forwards to your local Jenkins.

AWS
I. Create Maven-web-java project in eclipse & push into github
II. Create the virtual machine (EC2--instance) in aws and connect to
Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster.
Ex : Launch ubuntu instnace
Step 1: Login to AWS /canvas account
Step 2: Services -- EC2
Step 3: Choose region which is near ?
Services -- EC2 --- Launch Instance
Stage 1 --Name (Giving name to the machine) ubuntu
Stage 2 -- Select AMI ( Note: Select free tier eligible ) ubuntu server
Stage 3 -- Architecture as 64-bit
Stage 4 -- Instance type ---- t2.micro(default 1 CPU,1 GB RAM)
Stage 5 -- Create a new keypair---a keypair will downloaded with extension .pem
Store key in folder AWS
Stage 6 -- Network Setting ----Create Security group -- ( It deals with ports )
(Note for understanding We have 0 to 65535 ports. Every port is dedicated to special purpose)
Do this step : HERE select http and https
Stage 7 -- Storage - 8GB ( Observation - we have root - it is same as C Drive)
Stage 8 --- click on launch instance
Stage 9: Number of instances ---1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Observation - One machines created
Do this step:---once it is created select that instance and click on connect
Here copy the ssh – i command from SSH client connect tab
We can use powershell /gitbash /webconsole , to connect to ubuntu machine.
NOTE:- cd path of AWS folder // change path
To connect to above terminals we need to go into the path of the keypair.and
paste the
ssh -i command from the aws console
III. Clone the application from github, Write the Dockerfile
once connected to instance
Step 1:- Run the following commands to install s/w
1. Update all softwares in Ubuntu by command
sudo apt update
2. Install docker by command
sudo apt-get install docker.io
3. Install git by command
sudo apt install git
4. Install nano( text editor) by command
Sudo apt install nano
step 2:- git clone <paste the github link of maven-web-java project>
step 3:- navigate to the maven-web-java project
VI. Create the image
Step 4:- nano Dockerfile
V. Run the image and access it with public ip of virtual machine
Step 1:- build your image
docker build –t <imagename> .(dot)
Step 2:- check for images
Step 3:- run image
docker run –d --name app-demo –p 6060:8080 <image name>
Step:-4 Accessing the app by public ip of virtual machine
Note:-if your are not able to connect change the inbound rules..
